3d tennis simulator built entirely in Godot. Two white blocks (representing players) play tennis against one another with hard-corded state-based logic. Uses finite state machine. 

TODO:

1) Tweak ball hitting so that players are able to hit within court area more consistently.
2) Track when the ball is out or when a winner is hit.
3) Add real tennis scoring.
