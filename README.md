## Tennis Simulator

## About The Project
3D tennis simulator built entirely in Godot. Two white blocks (representing players) play tennis against one another with hard-corded state-based logic.

The project correctly implements these following mechanics:
* Players can enter a rally, including serve, return, and hit the ball back and forth.
* Players can hit ball differently based on their current playstyle (aggressive, defensive, neutral).
* Players can pick up ball and restart the rally once a point is over.

# How To Run

Project runs on Godot 4.4. Install all files and import them inside as a project inside the Godot engine.
