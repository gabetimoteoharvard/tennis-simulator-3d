## About The Project

3D tennis simulator built entirely in Godot. Two white blocks (representing players) play tennis against one another with hard-coded state-based logic.

### Implemented Mechanics

The project correctly implements these following mechanics:

- Players can enter a rally, including serve, return, and hit the ball back and forth.
- Players can hit ball differently based on their current playstyle (aggressive, defensive, neutral).
- Players can pick up ball and restart the rally once a point is over.
